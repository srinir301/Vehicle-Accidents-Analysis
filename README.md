# Vehicle-Accidents-Breakdown

Used Excel, SQL Server, and Power BI to analyze vehicle accident dataset from Kaggle. On Excel I simply looked at the data to get a better understanding through filtering and sorting. I split up the data into two separate datsets, VehicleAccidentsInv and VehicleAccidentsDesc. The VehicleAccidentsInv are the people, items, and vehicles involved in the accident and VehicleAccidentsDesc is the description of each vehicle accident. I used SQL to manipulate the data and get some findings from the dataset. For further detail on the SQL Server queries, you can look at my queries with comments in the SQL file. Lastly, I used Power BI to create a dashboard of visualizations such as a line chart, stacked column chart, and treemap.
